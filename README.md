# ðŸ“š bibtexer

An opinionated BibTeX file cleaner for computer science.

https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/main/quickstart.html
https://habanero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/crossref.html
https://github.com/greenBene/dblpy

## Goals

- BibTeX files as input and output
- Clean format, ready to be published
- Supplement bibliographic data from [DBLP](https://dblp.org/) and [CrossRef](https://crossref.org/)
- Adhere to [natbib](https://ctan.org/pkg/natbib) and [BibLaTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) standards
- Short identifiers to favor typing efficiency
- Favor a simple CLI over a fancy GUI
- BibTeX is the single source of truth
- Permissive license

## Conventions

- Favor DOIs over URLs
- Shorten journal names as per [TODO](somestandard)
- Use conference acronyms instead of full names:
  - Preceded with `Proceedings of`
- Identifiers in the form of `lastname:YYYY[x]`:
  - `lastname` is the last name of the first author, without diacritics
  - `YYYY` is the four-digit year of publication
  - `[x]` is an optional one-letter suffix (e.g., `a`, `b`, etc.) in case the same first author has published more than one paper in a year.
- arXiv papers are `@misc` entries
- Titles:
  - Remove trailing dot
  - Title case
  - Put entity names and abbreviations in {} (Wikidata?)


## Installation

Install [Python 3.10](https://python.org/downloads/) or higher and [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) (this allows you to install the BibTeXer CLI in a virtual environment).
Then, you can install the BibTeXer CLI by running:

```shell
pipx install bibtexer
```

If you do not want to use pipx, you can also install this tool with standard pip:

```shell
pip install --user bibtexer
```

## Usage

Now you can run the CLI by running:

```shell
bibtexer --help
```

## Development

First, install [Python 3.10](https://python.org/downloads/) or higher and then clone this repository.
From inside the repository directory, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the test dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .[tests]
```

After having implemented a new feature, please check the code format, inspect common LINT errors, and run all unit tests with the following commands:

```shell
ruff .                         # Code format and LINT
mypy .                         # Static typing
bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .  # Security
pytest .                       # Unit tests
```

## Contribute

If you have found a bug in this tool or feel like some feature is missing, please create an [issue](https://github.com/heinrichreimer/bibtexer/issues). We also gratefully accept [pull requests](https://github.com/heinrichreimer/bibtexer/pulls)!
